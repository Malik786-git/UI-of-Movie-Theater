# UI of Movie Theater
 In this project we'll be creating a seat selsctor UI for a movie theater. We will have a dropdown picker to select a movie, a legend to display if a seat is vacant, selexted, or already reserved, a drawing of the theater and also some text to display the number os seats selected by the user and the total cost of the tickets.
